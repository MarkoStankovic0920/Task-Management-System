## **Creating an Admin from the Shell in .NET Identity:**

To create an admin using .NET Identity from the shell, follow these steps:

1. Open a command-line interface or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where your .NET project is located.
3. Run the following command to open the .NET CLI:

   ```bash
   dotnet tool install --global dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator

    Once installed, run the following command to scaffold Identity pages into your project:

    bash

dotnet aspnet-codegenerator identity --useDefaultUI

After scaffolding Identity, navigate to the folder containing the ApplicationDbContext.cs file in your project.

Open a command-line interface or terminal in this directory.

Run the following command to add a new admin user:

bash

    dotnet ef migrations add InitialIdentityMigration
    dotnet ef database update

    Follow the prompts to create the admin user, providing the necessary information such as username, email, and password.

    Once the migration and database update are complete, the admin user will be created and can log in to the Task Management System with admin privileges.

This Task Management System offers a robust solution for organizations to streamline task management processes, allocate resources effectively, and monitor team performance efficiently. With role-based permissions and enhanced security measures, it ensures data integrity and confidentiality throughout the system.
